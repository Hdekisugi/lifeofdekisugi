Welcome to my WriteUp. Ok So before starts question we need to enumerate the mechine. So Let's do it with **nmap**

## Enumurate The Mechine



```
# nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial $ip                                                                                                                                1 âš™

```

**We Get**
```
Port Open
21 FTP (Anonymous Login Allow)
22 SSH 
80 HTTP 
```



## Enumurate FTP


The server allow us to login anonymously so just login and get what is inside.
```
	Username : Anonymous
	Password : Anonymous
	
```
	
File name is **note_to_jake.txt**

```
From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and 
holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine

```


## Enumurate HTTTP / Port 80



After visiting the website there is just a picture and some text in the bottom, Nothing usefull here. If you go to the code of the website then you can see at the bottom there is a text **<!-- Have you ever heard of steganography? -->**



So, Let's download the picture and do some steganography on it 

```
	wget $ip/brooklyn99.jpg
	I used steghide for cracking stuff if it ask for any password then use stegcracker first then steghide.
	If you don't know how to use steghide use the command steghide --help and at the bottom you will have some exmple I hope it will help you.
```


After cracking we have a file called **note.txt**


	
```
		H***ts Pass***rd:
		flu***og12@ni***ine

Enjoy!!
```
It looks like a username with password. We already check FTP and HTTP It's time to do something with SSH/Port 22. Use credintials from **note.txt** and login on SSH.

## Get into The Mechine


After Login

```
h**t@brookly_nine_nine:~$ ls
nano.save user.txt
h**t@brookly_nine_nine:~$ cat user.txt
ee1****19052**0b*7aa****060c23e*

```

Now we have user.txt It's time to root the mechine 

I used the command **sudo -l** to see what do we need to be **sudo**


```
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for holt on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ 
```

Here you can see **nano** can be sudo with no password. Now, you have to find how you can exploit a mechine VIA nano.

I always use **GTFObins** it's such a resourceful and helpful website for this type of exploit.

So, after you go to GTFObins search for nano then find sudo and do those things as it says.


After Being sudo


```
# cd /root && ls        
root.txt
# cat root.txt
-- Creator : Fsociety2006 --
Congratulations in rooting Brooklyn Nine Nine
Here is the flag: 63***0ea7bb9***0796b6*****4818*5

Enjoy!!
# 
```
